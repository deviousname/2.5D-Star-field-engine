# Generative Universe v1.2.2

Generative Universe is a procedural simulation of a dynamic and expansive 2D universe with interactive celestial objects. Explore an endless space populated by stars, planets, moons, and mysterious phenomena, all rendered with vibrant visuals and smooth animations.

## Features

- **Procedural Celestial Objects**: 
  - Stars of different types (e.g., Red Dwarfs, Blue Giants) with unique characteristics.
  - Planets and moons orbiting stars dynamically.
  - Phenomena like Pulsars, Quasars, Galaxies, and Nebulae with distinct effects.

- **Interactive Exploration**: 
  - Move through the universe with WASD controls and explore varying depths using Q/E.
  - Panning feature for intuitive drag-based exploration.

- **Dynamic Rendering**: 
  - Depth scaling for a realistic 3D-like parallax effect.
  - Fog effects for objects at extreme depths.
  - Vibrant glow and animation effects for stars and phenomena.

- **Spatial Partitioning**: 
  - Efficient culling using a spatial grid for smooth performance, even with hundreds of objects.

- **Tooltips**: 
  - Hover over objects to see detailed information about their type, composition, and effects.

- **Customizable Gameplay**: 
  - Adjust constants like movement speed, number of stars, and depth ranges to tailor the experience.

## Controls

- **W/A/S/D**: Move up, left, down, or right.
- **Q/E**: Change depth (zoom in/out).
- **Mouse Drag**: Pan the universe view.
- **Hover**: View detailed information about stars and phenomena.
